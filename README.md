# web-scraper

In this program, you'll need to add any necessary libraries for HTML parsing, such as HtmlAgilityPack, to parse and extract data from the downloaded web page. The example provided focuses on the basic structure of a web scraper and the exception handling for potential errors.

    It prompts the user to enter the URL of the website they want to scrape.
    It uses the WebClient class to download the HTML content of the specified URL.
    The downloaded HTML content is stored in the html string variable.
    At the TODO comment, you can implement your specific scraping logic using libraries like HtmlAgilityPack or regular expressions to parse and extract data from the HTML.
    If any error occurs during the scraping process, it will be caught in the catch block, and the error message will be displayed.
    Once the scraping is completed (or if an error occurs), the program prompts the user to press any key to exit.
